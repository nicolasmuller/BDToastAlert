#BDToastAlert - Self-managed HUD-style alert text.

##Overview

BDToastAlert provides you an easy way to display non-obstructive messages to 
user without having to worry about its behavior and conflicts with other views.

##version 1.0.0

The first major version release. 

And hence incompatibility with previous betas. :( Sorry early adopters, but this
version API is simpler, and more importantly, now it looks great! See below.

##How to use
Out of the box, all you need to do is first get the singleton

	BDToastAlert *toast = [BDToastAlert shared];

In order to display a message, call

	UIViewController *ctrl  = <a view contorllerâ€¦>
	[toast showToastWithText:@"Hello!" onViewController:ctrl];

That's it! You should see your text on the controller's view.

##Features

BDToastAlert works out of the box. However, you can customize it a bit if you like

- `BDToastVerticalAlignment` defines where the toast should appear on the specified view.
- `customToastViewClassName` defines the class name of your own custom toast view. 

###Customizing Toast 

Two ways:

####By Subclassing
Though you can start from scratch with a custom UIView for a custom toast view, I recommend subclassing the `BDDefaultToastView` class. This is the default view that `BDToastAlert` uses out of the box. 

An example for customizing toast view by subclassing `BDDefaultToastView`. 

To change the toast font, override the `-init` method, like this

	- (id)init
	{
	    self = [super init];
	    if (self) {
	        self.textLabel.font = <your font>;
	    }
	    return self;
	}

If you are guessing `textLabel` property is the `UILabel` on the `BDDefaultToastView` class, then you are correct. You can configure the label any way you like. For the background gradient, the following methods configure how it looks

- startGradientColor
- endGradientColor
- shadowColor
- backgroundRadius

####Start from scratch
You can subclass a `UIView` for your custom toast with the following requirements:

1. The view must conform to the `BDToastViewProtocol`
2. The designated initializer (i.e. all your init code must be in) is the `-init` method. This is because
3. In order to use it with `BDToastAlert`, set the class name to its `customToastViewClassName` property. The `BDToastAlert` singleton creates an instance of your custom toast view using `-init` method only.

##Requirements
- Requires ARC
- QuartzCore.framework

##How to use
- With CocoaPods, add to your dependency list.

    dependency 'BDToastAlert'

- Without CocoaPods, just include h/.m files in BDToastAlert folder to your project source code 
- See the sample project. There's really not much to it.
